**What was your experience?**
    
    -This is the first project I've ever made by myself using React JS and I find the entire process challenging yet enjoyable. React as a library comes with a set of features that I have yet all to explore. But since I plan to use it for all my web applications for the next few months to practice, I look forward to discover more ways around it until I am fully comfortable with this tool. I also used styled components for the styling of this project. I think it's just on par with SASS in terms of functionality and ease of use but it is definitely made with React developers in mind so I will be using this instead of SASS for now.
**What have you learned/improved?**
    
    -I've learned the basics of React in this project, including the built-in hooks and how to style the components. I opted for a very folder-type structure to organize my components with their own index files and styled components files. 
    
    -I think the use of the useEffect hook is extremely convenient and it might be my favorite part of React so far since I could easily use it to track down changes in another component and apply the necessary changes from that so there is no need to create mroe codes just to check for changes. I love it!
    
    -I learned how to clean up the useEffect hook to prevent data leakage. 
    
    -Using React is definitely good in terms of error management because it forces the user to fix all the warnings before deployment which is great in my opinion because this ensures a more quality code product.
    
    -I also used the material design icon pack for this using their npm package and it's a very easy way to add icons without downloading unnecessary files that could take up space and slow down the site.
**Your wisdom? :)**
    
    -Since this is the first React app I've built on my own after all the tutorials I watched, I felt a bit intimidated and scared at first but I continued to code through all the challenges, I was glad that I continued to push myself to elarn more about it. I know that most struggles happen in the beginning phase of each endeavor so I will continue to persist until I get through this point and feel more confident in my skills.
